• The admission form includes all the requirements specified in problem statement given by FLexmoney i.e the age limit, batch selection and the submit & pay button       that can be used as CompletePayment() function in future when it is actually implemented.\
• In the admission form we have implemented all the necessary validations required for the name, age and batch selection using YUP which is a JavaScript schema builder   for value parsing and validation.\
• We have also use the formik open source library for React.js which is basically used to handle the form.\
• Formik & Yup offer an easy, understandable and extensible solution to handling & validating forms in React.js .\
• For MySQL database and the local server we have used phpMyAdmin which is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB.\
• When the project gets exceuted on local machine the database gets connected to our project successfully and when we fill the admisssion form and click the submit &     pay button the data is sent to our MySQL database and the records in the database can be seen.\
